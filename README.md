My bachelor's thesis, entitled "Development of a low-cost intelligent cleaning robot – RoboCurățelul," aims to design and build an autonomous system capable of automating a frequently overlooked but essential household task: cleaning the grout between ceramic tiles. This activity, although seemingly simple, is often difficult, time-consuming, and physically demanding, which is why I wanted to offer a modern, efficient, and affordable technological solution. The project falls within the field of autonomous robotics and combines several technological areas such as image processing, embedded systems, mechatronics, and human-machine interaction. The main goal of the research was to develop a low-cost, intelligent robot that can detect, track, and sanitize tile grout without human intervention. The robot, called RoboCurățelul, consists of three main subsystems: processing and control, navigation and actuation, and detection and safety. The processing part is done using a Raspberry Pi 4 board, which manages the video camera and analyzes the images captured in real time, using the OpenCV library to identify the joints between the tiles. Based on this information, the robot calculates the optimal trajectory and transmits the commands to the actuation system. The hardware component is controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico board, which coordinates the motors, sensors, and cleaning brush. The robot is equipped with ultrasonic and infrared sensors to detect obstacles and navigate safely. In addition, interaction with the user is achieved through a graphical interface developed in Node-RED, which allows monitoring the status of the robot and selecting the operating mode. RoboCurățelul has three operating modes: manual, for direct control from the application; automatic for vacuuming the floor; and a special autonomous mode dedicated to cleaning joints. In this mode, the robot identifies the joint lines, automatically aligns itself, and cleans them with precision. By developing this project, I wanted to demonstrate that technology can be used to simplify everyday activities, bringing added comfort and hygiene to homes. We also sought to offer a viable and economical solution that could be extended in the future to commercial applications or other types of surfaces. In conclusion, RoboCurățelul is the result of a harmonious combination of theoretical knowledge and the practical application of modern concepts of robotics, artificial vision, and automation. The paper highlights the potential of intelligent technologies to transform repetitive household tasks into a fully automated process, accessible to any user, thus making a real contribution to the development of the field of autonomous domestic robots.
